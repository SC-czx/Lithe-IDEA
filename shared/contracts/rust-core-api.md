# Rust Core API

The Rust core is the shared application runtime for macOS SwiftUI and Windows
Qt/C++. Both bindings call the same C ABI:

```c
const char *lithe_core_version(void);
char *lithe_core_execute_json(const char *request);
char *lithe_core_lsp_provider_catalog_json(const char *workspace_root);
int32_t lithe_core_cancel(const char *operation_id);
void lithe_core_free_string(char *value);
```

The macOS package uses the small C bridge in `Sources/LitheRustCore/`. The
canonical C declarations are in `rust/lithe-core/include/lithe_core.h`.
Windows can link the same `staticlib` or `cdylib` and call these functions from
C++.
Strings returned by the core are UTF-8 JSON allocated by Rust. The caller must
release response strings with `lithe_core_free_string`.

## Envelope

Every request has this shape:

```json
{
  "id": "request-id",
  "operationId": "operation-id",
  "timeoutMilliseconds": 30000,
  "command": "workspace.search",
  "payload": {}
}
```

`operationId` is optional for compatibility and defaults to `id` when `id` is
present. `timeoutMilliseconds` is optional; a positive value starts a
cooperative deadline. `lithe_core_cancel` is thread-safe and returns `1` when
the operation is active. Cancellation and deadlines are checked at command
boundaries, workspace traversal points, and Git process waits. They return
`cancelled` or `timed_out` in the standard error envelope.

Successful responses contain `ok: true` and `data`. Failed responses contain a
stable error code and a user-facing message:

```json
{
  "id": "request-id",
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_request",
    "message": "Invalid JSON request"
  }
}
```

Workspace paths in responses are relative and use `/` separators. Line numbers
are one-based. `git.status.repositoryRoot` may be an absolute path when the
opened workspace is a subdirectory of the repository; all Git change paths are
relative to that repository root. The core rejects absolute paths and `..`
traversal for file commands. Native file dialogs, file watching, PTY/ConPTY,
Java processes, and runtime discovery remain platform adapters.

The protocol version is currently `1`. Add a fixture under `shared/fixtures/`
before changing a response shape or search rule.

`git.watchContext` accepts `{ "root": string }`. When `root` is not inside a
Git repository, it returns `null`. Otherwise it returns
`{ "repositoryRoot": string, "gitDirectory": string, "gitCommonDirectory": string }`;
all three fields are absolute filesystem paths.

`git.command` accepts `{ "root": string, "arguments": string[], "input": string? }`.
Arguments are passed directly to the Git executable without a shell. A
successful process launch returns `{ "output": string, "exitCode": number }`
even when Git exits non-zero; process-start and workspace failures use the
standard error envelope.

`git.write` accepts a typed mutation request. Its required `operation` values are
`stage`, `unstage`, `discard`, `discardAll`, `stageAll`, `commit`, `cherryPick`, `revert`,
`reset`, `createBranch`, `renameBranch`, `deleteBranch`, `merge`, `rebase`,
`fetch`, `pull`, `push`, `checkout`, `checkoutRevision`, `clone`, `stashPush`,
`stashApply`, `stashPop`, and `stashDrop`. Optional fields are `paths`,
`reference`, `referenceKind`, `revision`, `name`, `message`, `remote`,
`destination`, `mode`, `includeUntracked`, `checkout`, and `amend`.

The core validates pathspecs, revisions, branch names, references, reset modes,
stash references, and operation-specific required fields before invoking Git.
Successful process launch returns `{ "output": string, "exitCode": number }`
even when Git exits non-zero. Invalid arguments use the standard
`invalid_request` error envelope. `checkout` uses `referenceKind` values
`local`, `remote`, or `tag`; `clone` uses `remote` as its source and
`destination` as its target path.

`git.diff` accepts `root`, `pathspecs`, optional `reference` or `commit`,
`staged`, `untracked`, `contextLines`, and `ignoreAllWhitespace`, and returns `{ "patch": string, "rows": [],
"hunks": [] }`. Rows contain one-based `oldLine`/`newLine` values where
available, `left`/`right` text, a `kind` (`context`, `changed`, `addition`,
`removal`, or `information`), and an optional `hunkID`. For `context` and
`information` rows both sides carry identical text, so `right` is omitted and
clients must fall back to `left`. Hunk entries contain their header and the
patch text needed for partial apply; rows are not duplicated per hunk, so
clients group `rows` by `hunkID` instead.
`git.apply` accepts `root`, `patch`, and `mode`; supported modes are `stage`,
`unstage`, `discard`, `restoreIndex`, `worktree`, `restoreIndexCheck`, and
`worktreeCheck`. The two `*Check` modes only test whether the reverse patch
already applies, so Shelf restoration can be retried after a partial failure.
It returns
`{ "output": string, "exitCode": number }`. `restoreIndex` applies a saved
index patch to both the index and worktree; `worktree` applies only to the
worktree. Pathspecs must be workspace-relative and must not contain absolute
paths or `..` components.

`git.history` accepts `root`, an optional full `reference`, and `limit` (the
core clamps it to `1...5000`). It returns `references`, `commits`, and
`hasMore`; commit parents are explicit so clients can render merge topology
without re-parsing Git output.

`git.commit` accepts `root` and a revision, returning one `commit` object.
`git.blame` accepts `root` and a workspace-relative `path`; its line numbers
are one-based and author timestamps are Unix seconds.

`workspace.search` accepts `maxResults` for a total result cap. Callers that
need separate buckets may also provide `maxFileResults` and
`maxContentResults`; each category is capped independently and the total cap
still applies.

`workspace.searchEverywhere` uses the same query options and visibility fields,
and additionally accepts `maxSymbolResults`. Results are ordered as file,
type, symbol, and content matches. Java type and method results include a
one-based line, `symbolName`, and the matching source line in `preview`.

`workspace.replacePreview` accepts `root`, `query`, `replacement`, the same
query options, optional workspace-relative `paths`, optional `textOverrides`
keyed by relative path, and visibility fields. It returns `{ "files": [] }`
where each file contains replacement matches and the complete
`replacementText` to write. The command never writes files; callers can record
history before using `file.write` for the selected files.

`lsp.applyTextEdits` accepts `{ "text": string, "edits": [] }`, where each edit
has an LSP range with zero-based `line` and UTF-16 `utf16Column` fields plus
`newText`. Ranges are validated and overlapping edits return
`invalid_request` with details `overlappingEdits`; invalid positions return
details `invalidRange`. Successful responses return `{ "text": string }`.

`lsp.plainSnippet` accepts `{ "value": string }` and returns `{ "text": string }`
after removing LSP tab stops and replacing simple placeholder defaults such as
`${1:name}` with `name`.

`lsp.builtinCompletions`, `lsp.builtinHover`, and `lsp.builtinNavigation` are
the no-process lightweight language path. They accept current-file text, an
absolute `filePath`, and a zero-based LSP position. Completion returns
current-file identifiers with text edits for the active prefix. Hover returns
the current identifier as markdown. Navigation returns current-file locations;
definition prefers declaration-looking occurrences, while references returns
all matching identifier occurrences. These commands are deliberately
text-level fallbacks; precise type-aware behavior belongs to a started language
server.

The LSP provider catalog is returned by `lithe_core_lsp_provider_catalog_json`.
Each provider descriptor may include `languageServerLaunch` with ordered
`executableNames` and `arguments`; Swift adapters use this metadata when they
need to discover a real language-server executable; the selected launch plan is
then submitted to the Rust-owned runtime. Built-in descriptors are merged by provider ID with the optional
`.lithe/lsp/language-providers.json` workspace document. See
[`language-tooling.md`](../../docs/architecture/language-tooling.md) for routing,
discovery, lifecycle, and compatibility rules.

The `lsp.*Server`, `lsp.*Document`, `lsp.request`, and `lsp.pollEvents`
commands are the semantic LSP runtime boundary. `lsp.startServer` accepts the
provider ID, selected executable/arguments/environment, root URI, working
directory, initialization options, optional runtime executable and cache
directory, plus initialize/request/shutdown deadlines. Rust owns the returned
session's child process, stdin/stdout/stderr, framing buffer, JSON-RPC request
IDs, document versions, pending deadlines, capabilities, diagnostics, and
graceful/forced termination.

`lsp.syncDocument` accepts `{ sessionId, uri, languageId, text }`; the first
sync emits `didOpen` at version 1 and later syncs emit full-text `didChange`
with increasing versions. `lsp.request` accepts a semantic `operation` plus
the operation-specific URI, position, range, diagnostics, item, action, or
command fields, and returns `{ operationId }`. Supported operations include
completion, hover, definition/declaration/type-definition, references,
implementation, rename, formatting, code actions and resolve, execute command,
inlay hints, folding ranges, code lens, and provider virtual documents.

`lsp.pollEvents` drains events ordered by per-session `sequence`. Event types
include `stateChanged`, `featuresChanged`, `diagnostics`,
`requestCompleted`, `serverInfoChanged`, and `log`. Every request completes at
most once with either `result` or a structured runtime error containing
provider/session, stage, optional method/document/request, stable code, and
optional process-exit detail. Late responses after cancellation or deadline
are ignored. Diagnostics are accepted only for documents open in the current
session, and versioned diagnostics must match the current document version.

The client reducer, raw JSON-RPC message, frame, and parser functions are
internal Rust implementation seams; they are not public application commands.
Completion, hover, navigation, edit, hint, folding, and code-lens responses are
normalized by Rust before they cross the application boundary. Unknown server
requests receive JSON-RPC `Method not found` instead of being silently ignored.

The `history.*` commands accept an adapter-selected `storageRoot`; history
metadata never stores an absolute workspace or storage path. `history.record`
accepts `workspaceRoot`, a relative `path`, a `reason`, and optional UTF-8
`content`; when content is omitted the core reads the workspace file. Records
are versioned, de-duplicated against the latest snapshot, capped at 100 entries
per file, and pruned after 30 days. Invalid metadata and missing snapshot files
are ignored. `history.entries` returns Unix-second timestamps and relative
`contentPath` values. `history.content` rejects traversal, and
`history.relocate` updates metadata and storage paths at the command boundary.

`maven.scan` accepts `{ "root": string, "paths"?: string[] }` and returns
`null` when neither the root nor the supplied visible workspace-relative paths
contain a readable `pom.xml`. Candidates are tried in shallowest-first order,
with `/`-normalized lexical paths breaking ties, until one parses successfully;
a malformed candidate does not hide a valid nested project. A project response
contains its workspace `relativePath`,
`groupId`, `artifactId`, `version`, `packaging`, recursive `modules`, `profiles`,
and `hasWrapper`. Module paths are relative to the selected Maven root and use
`/` separators. Malformed XML returns `parse_failed`.

`maven.diagnostics` accepts `{ "root": string, "output": string }` and returns
`{ "issues": [] }`. Diagnostic paths may be absolute or workspace-relative;
the response preserves the path text, uses one-based line and column values,
and normalizes severity to `error` or `warning`. Duplicate issue lines are
removed deterministically.

`java.runConfigurations` accepts `{ "root": string, "paths": string[],
"modulePaths": string[] }`. Java and module paths are workspace-relative. The response
contains detected `mainClasses` and deterministic `configurations`; process
launching remains a platform adapter responsibility.

The `runConfig.*` commands implement the versioned project protocol described
by the JSON Schemas in this directory. `runConfig.inspect` accepts `root` and
never writes files. `runConfig.generate` accepts `root`, relative Java `paths`,
and relative `modulePaths`; it returns generated configuration and toolchain
requirement documents for the platform adapter to write atomically.

`runConfig.resolve` accepts `root` and optional local `toolchainCandidates`.
It merges configurations by stable ID using this precedence:
`local.json > configurations.json > generated.json`. Scalars and arrays are
replaced by the higher layer, while toolchain maps merge by key. It returns
effective configurations, their source, the team default, and structured
diagnostics for stale, orphaned, missing, disabled, and toolchain mismatch
states.

`runConfig.updateOptions` and `runConfig.createUserConfiguration` are pure
document transformations. They validate scope, paths, supported types, stable
IDs, main classes, modules, and argument parsing, then return UTF-8 JSON in the
`document` field. The platform adapter selects the target project or local
file and performs the atomic write. These commands never write files.

`runConfig.createLaunchPlan` accepts `root`, `configurationId`, optional
`currentFile` and `classPath`, and optional `debugPort`. It returns a toolchain
reference, argument array, project-relative working directory, and structured
environment references. It does not return a shell command or platform
executable path. All project paths use `/`, reject absolute paths and `..`
traversal, and remain relative to `root`.

`java.codeVision` accepts a workspace root, a target Java path, and Java source
paths. It returns declaration locations and usage counts; Git blame attribution
is joined by the UI from the shared Git result. `java.className` accepts Java
source text and a file simple name and returns the fully qualified runtime class
name.

`java.sourceDefinition` accepts `source`, `declarationName`, and an optional
`memberName`, returning zero-based `line` and UTF-16 `utf16Column` or `null`
when no declaration is found.

`java.structure` accepts Java `source` and optional `declarationSources`. It
returns `foldRegions`, `implementationMarkers`, and `inlayHints`. Line numbers
are zero-based because these values are editor offsets; UTF-16 columns and
hidden ranges match the native text editor coordinate system. The parser is
platform-independent and does not start a Java process or contact JDT.
