//! Language-agnostic discovery of runnable services.
//!
//! The engine walks a project once, groups the manifest files it finds by
//! directory, and hands each directory to every detector. Detectors never walk
//! the tree themselves: a shared walk is the only way the cost stays bounded as
//! ecosystems are added.
//!
//! An ecosystem whose layout is *declared* rather than discovered reads its own
//! manifest graph instead -- see `maven`. The caller selects the Maven root
//! because it may sit below the opened workspace. That is not a shortcut around
//! the shared walk: a declared graph names directories the walk prunes, and
//! omits ones it would visit.
