# Repository Layout and Sharing Rules

Lithe contains two independent platform applications connected by a small set
of shared contracts. macOS is the current reference product. Windows is a
Qt/C++ implementation in progress; it must not import Swift source or depend
on macOS types.

## Top-level layout

```

## Platform layers

The macOS package is intentionally kept at the repository root so existing
SwiftPM, release, and preview commands remain stable:

```text
SwiftUI/AppKit → AppModel → Application Feature Models → AppServices
                                      ├── Rust Core operations
                                      └── macOS ports and adapters
```

The Windows implementation has the corresponding native layers:

```text
windows/qt/       Qt Widgets workbench and UI state
windows/core/     C++ client for the Rust JSON C ABI
windows/adapters/ Win32 file, watcher, process, terminal, runtime, and storage adapters
```

Both platforms consume `rust/lithe-core` through the same JSON envelope and
command names. Shared behavior belongs in `shared/contracts/` and should have
a fixture under `shared/fixtures/` before the second platform relies on it.

## Rust Core packages

`rust/lithe-core/src/lib.rs` is only the crate composition root and public API. Rust implementation files are grouped by stable ownership boundary instead of being added beside `lib.rs`:

```text
rust/lithe-core/src/
├── protocol/    # command names, wire contracts, responses, errors, events, cancellation
├── runtime/     # JSON dispatcher and C ABI exports
├── project/     # files/search, local history, Markdown, Maven project inspection
├── execution/   # run configuration, launch/toolchain models, project detectors
├── languages/   # language-specific source inspection such as Java
├── git/         # Git validation, parsing, state, and mutations
├── lsp/         # generic LSP, lightweight fallback, provider/Swift adapters
└── tests/       # command-level tests grouped by the same domains
```

The dependency direction is `protocol <- domain packages <- runtime/FFI`. A domain may use protocol contracts, but it must not depend on the runtime dispatcher. `execution/types.rs` is the shared type layer for configuration and detectors, so those modules do not import each other through the package facade. `lsp/mod.rs` and the other package `mod.rs` files are compatibility facades; new implementation logic belongs in an owned submodule rather than in the facade.

Moving Rust files must not change JSON command strings, Serde field names, error codes, or the exported C symbols. Directory-sensitive fixtures and embedded resources must use `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` instead of paths derived from a module's current depth.

## Ownership rules

| Shared Rust Core | Platform-owned adapters |
| --- | --- |
| Workspace traversal and search rules | Root selection and directory watching |
| UTF-8 file command validation and results | Native file APIs, permissions, and persistence paths |
| Git models, validation, parsing, and mutations | Executable environment and credentials |
| History metadata and snapshot rules | History storage location and file movement |
| Language provider catalog, lightweight features, complete LSP runtime, Maven, and Java source parsing | Language-server/JDK/Maven discovery; Maven/Debug child processes |
| Error codes, cancellation, deadlines, and JSON envelope | PTY/ConPTY, signals, handles, and native UI |

The UI must depend on feature models and shared models, not on a concrete
adapter. Core and Services must remain free of AppKit, SwiftUI, Win32, Qt,
`Process`, and direct platform file APIs.

Language tooling has an additional protocol/application split: Rust owns the
complete LSP process/session runtime and normalized results, while platform
services own discovery, provider routing, and UI projection. The complete rules are in
[`language-tooling.md`](language-tooling.md).

## Repository hygiene

Do not commit generated outputs such as `.build/`, `.swiftpm/`, `dist/`,
`DerivedData/`, fixture build directories, or local IDE configuration. Keep
release notes, contract fixtures, verification scripts, and the screenshots
referenced by the public README files.
