# macOS Service Boundaries

The macOS application uses a stable Rust Core boundary and a native adapter
layer. SwiftUI and AppKit render the product, application feature models own UI
state transitions, and macOS adapters provide capabilities that cannot be
shared with Windows.

`MacServiceContainer` is the macOS composition root. It creates the Rust Core
bridge, Rust-backed workspace/Git/history/Java operations, Swift services, and
macOS adapters, then injects them into `AppServices`. A future Windows
composition root must construct the same application-facing ports with Windows
implementations.

## Source ownership

| Directory | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `Sources/Lithe/Views/` | SwiftUI/AppKit presentation, input, navigation destinations, and view-local rendering. |
| `Sources/Lithe/Models/` | UI-facing models and value types. `AppModel` is the observable aggregate, not the platform composition root. |
| `Sources/Lithe/Application/` | Workspace, Document, Git, Search, Java, Terminal, Project History, and UI Feature Models. These coordinate state and user actions. |
| `Sources/Lithe/Services/` | Product workflow orchestration. Language feature routing plus Maven/Run/Debug lifecycles remain Swift workflows; the LSP service is a semantic facade over the Rust runtime. |
| `Sources/Lithe/Core/Ports/` | Platform-neutral interfaces for process, terminal, storage, runtime discovery, file operations, watchers, and native UI capabilities. |
| `Sources/Lithe/Core/Rust*` | Typed operations and model conversion for the shared Rust JSON contract. |
| `Sources/Lithe/Platform/MacOS/` | FSEvents, file operations, persistence, process sessions, PTY, runtime discovery, native UI, shortcuts, and updates. |
| `rust/lithe-core/` | Shared commands, validation, parsing, ordering, Git operations, history, and JSON/C ABI. |

## Rules

Core ports and application code must not import SwiftUI, AppKit, CoreServices,
or concrete `Mac*` types. They must not construct `Process`, `Pipe`,
`FileManager`, `UserDefaults`, or `FileHandle` directly.

Services must receive those capabilities through ports. A Service may own a
workflow state machine, such as language-provider routing or Maven/Debug
lifecycle, but it must not decide how the operating system starts, watches,
stores, or terminates the underlying resource. The Rust LSP runtime is the
sole owner of its child process, stdio, JSON-RPC state, document versions,
request deadlines, diagnostics, and message normalization.

Views receive `AppModel` or a dedicated UI Feature Model. They must not receive
concrete workflow services, call the Rust C ABI directly, or construct platform
adapters.

The Rust Core owns deterministic cross-platform behavior:

- workspace snapshots, UTF-8 file reads/writes, search, and replacement preview;
- Git status, Diff, History, Blame, Stash, branch operations, remote sync,
  Clone, Commit, and patch application;
- Local History metadata and snapshot operations;
- Maven descriptor and diagnostic parsing;
- Java source structure, code vision, class-name, and run-configuration parsing;
- lightweight language features and the complete LSP runtime: process,
  stdio/framing, lifecycle, documents, deadlines, capabilities, diagnostics,
  provider adapters, and normalized feature results;
- request envelopes, cancellation, deadlines, error codes, validation, and
  stable JSON ordering.

macOS owns the platform side of these capabilities:

- workspace selection, FSEvents, atomic/native file operations, permissions,
  persistence location, and Finder integration;
- language-server/JDK/Maven discovery and platform environment resolution;
- Java/Maven/Debug process transports, terminal PTY, shell, signals, and
  native handles (LSP process transport belongs to Rust);
- native window, menu, clipboard, shortcut, installer, and update behavior.

## Verification

Run this check after changing an application boundary:

```bash
scripts/verify-service-boundaries.sh
```

The script rejects platform imports and concrete adapter references in Core and
Services, direct workflow-service dependencies in Views, platform composition
in `AppModel`, and an oversized UI aggregate. Shared JSON behavior is checked
with `scripts/verify-shared-contracts.sh` and `scripts/verify-rust-core.sh`.

## Remaining migration work

The current boundary is usable and enforced, but it is not a claim that every
workflow has moved into Rust. Language provider routing remains an application
workflow, while the LSP process lifecycle and protocol state are shared Rust
contracts. Maven execution, Java Run/Debug sessions, and terminal session
state still use Swift platform ports. See
[`language-tooling.md`](language-tooling.md) for the language tooling split.
